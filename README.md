## Welcome to freeCodeCamp's dat:// protocol Git Repo!

While currently unofficial this uses the same curriculum you are used to just in a different way. Anyone interested in browsing our version of freeCodeCamp will need to install the [dat protocol](https://docs.datproject.org/install) and the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/install).

> Dat is a nonprofit-backed community & open protocol for building apps of the future. The Dat Project imagines a web of commons created by global communities on open and secure protocols. We set out to improve access to public data and created a new protocol along the way, read more at datprotocol.com. In our work on developing Dat, we found a under-served need. Decentralized software has potential to return control of digital information to the people. Today, building peer-to-peer applications presents both technical and ethical challenges but Dat is slowly changing that.

> Beaker is a more powerful browser, for a more powerful Web. We believe the Web is at its best when it empowers creation and encourages participation. That's why we're building a browser for a person-to-person Web.

We believe that freeCodeCamp on the dat protocol can bring many benefits to the freeCodeCamp community.

1. freeCodeCamp would no longer need to pay for server hosting. Using P2P (Peer-to-Peer) seeding all of you learning from freeCodeCamp will help host the site for your fellow campers. Being a non-profit these savings can mean a lot.
2. All of **your** user data will be hosted on **your** computer. While freeCodeCamp doesn't store much sensitive information you can feel more secure now that your data won't be centralized.

We have created on YouTube video tutorial on Dat and the Beaker Browser. This video talks about what Dat is and how it works, as well as how to create your first website in Dat. You can find that video here (when video is made add link) on the official freeCodeCamp YouTube.

In addition we have created a more in-depth article about Dat, Beaker Browser, and moving freeCodeCamp to the P2P web. You can find that article on freeCodeCamps Medium publication (Add link when article is written).

## Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!

freeCodeCamp is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take beginner programmers around 300 hours to learn.

Each of these 30 project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally, and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before submitting it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local development environment.

Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.
